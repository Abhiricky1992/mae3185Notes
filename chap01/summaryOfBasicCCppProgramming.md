# Summary of Basic C/C++ Programming
This book assumes that students who want to learn mechatronics do know how to write a program in C/C++. Having the understanding of the basic concepts like preprocessor directives, data types, operators, conditional statements, loops, arrays, etc. will facilitate the understanding codes discussed in this book. Thus, this chapter provides a summary of such concepts. Majority of the material discussed in this chapter is derived from [C - Quick Guide](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_quick_guide.htm).
